\section*{Acknowledgements}
First and foremost i would like to thank my supervisor Prof. Jan M. Pawlowski for giving me the opportunity to work on my desired topic and for always finding the time to discuss about open questions and the physical concepts this work is based on. I learned a lot about theoretical physics and had the chance to get in contact with a very interesting, modern research topic. 

I want to thank Prof. J\"org J\"ackel for his interest and for agreeing to become the second referee for this thesis.

Maybe the most important new experience for me was to be part of a research group and i have to say that i had a really great time at Philosophenweg 12! I have to thank the whole Quantum Gravity group for the nice atmosphere and many interesting and helpful discussions.  Especially, i have to thank Gustavo Brito for all the interesting blackboard sessions, which improved  my understanding of the subject a lot and Stefan Lippoldt for introducing me  to the problem with the background field approximation.
