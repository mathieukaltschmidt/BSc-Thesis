\chapter{Conclusion}\label{chap:Conclusion}
In this thesis, we investigated the Asymptotic Safety scenario for quantum gravity and studied its phase diagram within the Einstein-Hilbert truncation in a background field approximation. We used non-perturbative Functional Renormalization Group techniques to compute the running of Newton's constant $g_k$ and of the cosmological constant $\lambda_k$.  \\

In chapters 1 to 3 we introduced the background knowledge, needed for a general understanding of the conducted calculations. After briefly discussing the general idea of the Asymptotic Safety conjecture, in chapter \ref{chap:EHT} we solved the flow equation for a pure-gravity system in a transverse-traceless spin-two graviton approximation to get a first insight into the underlying structures of the theory setting. The mathematical tools we used to solve the flow equation, such as the York decomposition of the fluctuation field and the heat-kernel techniques to compute the functional traces, were introduced very detailed. We computed the $\beta$-functions for $g_k$ and $\lambda_k$ and determined the fixed points of the flow. Besides the non-interacting Gaussian fixed point at $(g_k, \lambda_k)=(0, 0)$ we found an UV-attractive fixed point at $(g_k, \lambda_k)=(0.86, 0.18)$, providing further evidence for the Asymptotic scenario as a promising candidate for a non-perturbative renormalizable quantum field theory of gravity. In chapter \ref{chap:Matter} we extended our truncation: First, the previously neglected trace mode and the Faddeev-Popov ghosts associated with the graviton sector were included to complete the calculation from chapter \ref{chap:EHT}. Then we investigated the impact of minimally coupled scalars, fermions and gauge fields on the Non-Gaussian Fixed point. We explained in full detail how to solve the functional traces for all three matter types separately and presented the most important and insightful steps. After finishing the computation of all contributions, we were able to determine the $\beta$-functions for $g_k$ and $\lambda_k$ as a function of the number of matter fields. Neglecting all the contributions from the different anomalous dimensions and expanding the beta functions in some neighbourhood of the Gaussian fixed point up to second order in the couplings, we qualitatively analyzed the behavior of the values for both couplings. We found \dots
These results are almost in agreement with the results from earlier investigations, where similar conventions have been chosen, see e.\,g \cite{DonaEichhornPercacci2013}.
At the end, in chapter \ref{chap:BGindependence}, we highlighted some problems associated with the background field approximation, e.\,g. the loss of background independence as a consequence of violating the Nielsen identities. \\

This work may not provide fundamentally new results, but it still demonstrates some of the central concepts and calculations related to the subject. Compared to more recent results, the outcomes of our calculations should be treated with care. Nevertheless, this thesis provides a suitable framework for further investigations of asymptotically safe quantum gravity. Based on our discussion from chapter \ref{chap:BGindependence}, one may think about abandoning the background field approximation in future projects.
