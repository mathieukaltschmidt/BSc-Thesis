The structure of this work is the following. In chapter \ref{chap:QFT} the field theoretical language and the Functional Renormalization Group (FRG) are introduced. A derivation of Wetterich's exact renormalization group equation, a.\,k.\,a. the flow equation,  completes our discussion of non-perturbative approaches to quantum field theory. Chapter \ref{chap:GR} provides the background knowledge on gravity and curved spacetimes. In chapter \ref{chap:EHT}, as a first step towards quantum gravity, the Asymptotic Safety approach is motivated and the flow equation is solved within the Einstein-Hilbert truncation in a transverse-traceless spin-2 graviton approximation. Our calculation is extended in chapter \ref{chap:Matter}, by taking minimally coupled scalar, fermion and gauge fields into account. In chapter \ref{chap:BGindependence} we critically review the background field approximation.
The results are summarized and discussed in chapter \ref{chap:Conclusion}. To conclude this work, an outlook on current progress and open questions in Asymptotic Safety research is presented.
