# My BSc Thesis in Theoretical Physics
Organization of my Bachelor Thesis in Theoretical Physics about Functional Renormalization, the Einstein-Hilbert Truncation and the Asymptotic Safety approach to Quantum Gravity under supervision of Prof. Jan M. Pawlowski at the Institute for Theoretical Physics at Heidelberg University in 2019. 

This repository contains:

- The final version of my thesis.
- The final version of my thesis defense presentation.
- Most of the references.
- A Mathematica script to determine the Non-Gaussian fixed points for the chosen setting numerically.
